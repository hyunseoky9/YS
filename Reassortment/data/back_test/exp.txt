this one records the mean k of seg1 and seg2.
the records are:
-seg1 with no back mutation
-seg1 with back mutation
-seg2 with no back mutation
-seg2 with back mutation
for each, mu ranges from 0.0002 to 0.0012

FINDING:
With back mutation model, When mu is low, seg2 dies more.
But when mu is high, seg1 dies more. 

With no back mutation model, about equal number of deaths occur in 100 runs 
with different mu
