Todo:
check if 1.2 follow f0 eq when there's no mutation for 1 segment and 2 segment
- try parallelizing the 1.2 version.

File nomenclature:
c1.2s_(params) -> c = comp, 1.2 = ver, s = stat
param order: rep,L,s,N0,K,mu,gen_num,cost,r


Comments/findings:

- 1.3 slower than 1.2 because it has to make 1000 indivs (and even more sampling) every generation.
