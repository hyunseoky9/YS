Todo:
check if 1.2 follow f0 eq when there's no mutation for 1 segment and 2 segment

- change starting ratio, when the params are set for 2seg winning.

- check if, on the turn of the next ratchet, the next least loaded class is 1.6*n0 (look at 1segements). See if the timing of approaching 1.6*n0 gets slower with smaller n0 and s. 

- try parallelizing the 1.2 version.

- read haig

problem with parallel:
somehow when running the generations, it's not running the same way as it was sequential....
Gotta check where its wrong starting from the top of the script.


File nomenclature:
c1.2s_(params) -> c = comp, 1.2 = ver, s = stat
param order: rep,L,s,N0,K,mu,gen_num,cost,r

Questions:
- should mutation reflect fitness of the current generation or only of the next generation?

Comments/findings:

- as ratio of 1seg:2seg gets to around 7:3, 1segments start to win with mutation rate 0.005.
