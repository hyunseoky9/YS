Todo:
check if 1.2 follow f0 eq when there's no mutation for 1 segment and 2 segment

- see if smaller population allows no back mutation model to resist muller's ratchet effect.

- track only ratios of k (f0, f1, f2, etc.)

- make wf model. comp1.3?

- read all relevent papers downloaded on 3.29

- change starting ratio, when the params are set for 2seg winning.

- check if, on the turn of the next ratchet, the next least loaded class is 1.6*n0 (look at 1segements). See if the timing of approaching 1.6*n0 gets slower with smaller n0 and s. 

- try parallelizing the 1.2 version.

File nomenclature:
c1.2s_(params) -> c = comp, 1.2 = ver, s = stat
param order: rep,L,s,N0,K,mu,gen_num,cost,r


Comments/findings:

- as ratio of 1seg:2seg gets to around 7:3, 1segments start to win with mutation rate 0.005.

- with mutation 0.0006, no back mutation model goes to average of k=12, whereas back mutation model goes to average of only k=2.5

- with no back, the ratio of wins tend to be 550/330 (seg1/seg2).... (from win_ratio data) what does this mean?
